# Episode 5: Building & Distribution

!!! info "Learning Objectives"
    By the end of this episode, you will:
    
    - Build wheel and source distributions
    - Understand semantic versioning
    - Publish packages to PyPI
    - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
    - Create basic documentation
    - Understand package metadata and README rendering

## 🎬 Taking kir-pydemo to the World

Sarah's `kir-pydemo` package is polished, tested, and ready! But how does she share it?

> "I want colleagues at other institutions to use this. How do I get it on PyPI so they can just `pip install kir-pydemo`? And how do I make sure each release is properly tested?"

**The solution?** Build distributions and set up automated publishing!

## 📦 Understanding Package Distribution

### Types of Distributions

Python packages can be distributed in two formats:

#### 1. Source Distribution (sdist)

A compressed archive (.tar.gz) of your source code:

```
kir-pydemo-0.1.0.tar.gz
├── src/
│   └── kir_pydemo/
├── tests/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
└── LICENSE
```

- **Pros**: Works on any platform, includes everything
- **Cons**: Requires build tools, slower to install
- **When**: Fallback when wheels aren't available

#### 2. Wheel (.whl)

A pre-built package ready for installation:

```
kir_pydemo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

- **Pros**: Fast installation, no build required
- **Cons**: May need platform-specific builds (for C extensions)
- **When**: Preferred format for distribution

The filename tells you:
```
kir_pydemo - 0.1.0 - py3 - none - any .whl
    |         |      |     |     |
  package  version  py3  no ABI universal
                         (pure Python)
```

## 🏗️ Building Your Package

### Step 1: Install Build Tools

```bash
pip install build twine
```

- **build**: Creates wheels and sdist
- **twine**: Uploads packages to PyPI

### Step 2: Build the Distributions

```bash
# Build both wheel and source distribution
python -m build

# Output:
# Successfully built kir_pydemo-0.1.0.tar.gz and kir_pydemo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

This creates a `dist/` directory:

```
dist/
├── kir_pydemo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
└── kir_pydemo-0.1.0.tar.gz
```

### Step 3: Check the Build

```bash
# Verify the distribution
twine check dist/*

# Output:
# Checking dist/kir_pydemo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl: PASSED
# Checking dist/kir_pydemo-0.1.0.tar.gz: PASSED
```

### Step 4: Test Install Locally

```bash
# Create a fresh virtual environment
python -m venv test-env
source test-env/bin/activate

# Install from the wheel
pip install dist/kir_pydemo-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl

# Test it works
kir-pydemo gc-content ATGC
# Output: GC content: 50.00%

# Deactivate and cleanup
deactivate
rm -rf test-env
```

## 🔢 Semantic Versioning

Version numbers communicate compatibility and changes:

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  |     |     |
  |     |     └─ Bug fixes (backwards compatible)
  |     └─────── New features (backwards compatible)
  └───────────── Breaking changes (NOT backwards compatible)
```

### Examples

- `0.1.0` → `0.1.1`: Fixed a bug
- `0.1.1` → `0.2.0`: Added new feature (reverse_complement)
- `0.2.0` → `1.0.0`: First stable release
- `1.0.0` → `2.0.0`: Changed API (breaking change)

### Pre-releases

```
1.0.0a1   # Alpha release 1
1.0.0b1   # Beta release 1
1.0.0rc1  # Release candidate 1
1.0.0     # Final release
```

### Version in pyproject.toml

**Static version:**
```toml
[project]
version = "0.1.0"
```

**Dynamic version** (from code):
```toml
[project]
dynamic = ["version"]

[tool.setuptools.dynamic]
version = {attr = "kir_pydemo.__version__"}
```

Then in `src/kir_pydemo/__init__.py`:
```python
__version__ = "0.1.0"
```

!!! tip "Version Management Tools"
    - **bump2version**: CLI tool to bump versions
    - **poetry version**: Poetry's version management
    - **setuptools_scm**: Git tag-based versioning
    
    Example with setuptools_scm:
    ```toml
    [build-system]
    requires = ["setuptools>=61.0", "setuptools-scm"]
    
    [project]
    dynamic = ["version"]
    
    [tool.setuptools_scm]
    ```

## 🚀 Publishing to PyPI

### Test on TestPyPI First

[TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) is a separate instance for testing:

```bash
# Create account on https://test.pypi.org/account/register/

# Upload to TestPyPI
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Install from TestPyPI to verify
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ kir-pydemo
```

### Publish to PyPI

```bash
# Create account on https://pypi.org/account/register/

# Upload to PyPI
twine upload dist/*

# Enter your credentials or use API token
```

!!! warning "Package Name Availability"
    Check if the name is available first:
    ```bash
    pip search kir-pydemo  # Deprecated, use web search instead
    ```
    Visit https://pypi.org/project/kir-pydemo to check.

### Using API Tokens (Recommended)

Create an API token on PyPI:

1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/account/
2. Create a new API token
3. Store it safely

**Option 1: .pypirc file**

Create `~/.pypirc`:
```ini
[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmc...

[testpypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-AgENdGVzdC5weXBp...
```

**Option 2: Environment variable**

```bash
export TWINE_USERNAME=__token__
export TWINE_PASSWORD=pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmc...

twine upload dist/*
```

## 🤖 Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

Automate testing and publishing with GitHub Actions:

### Step 1: Create Workflow Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### Step 2: Create CI Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        python-version: ['3.9', '3.10', '3.11', '3.12']
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -e ".[dev]"
    
    - name: Lint with ruff
      run: |
        ruff check src/ tests/
    
    - name: Type check with mypy
      run: |
        mypy src/
    
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest --cov=kir_pydemo --cov-report=xml
    
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
      with:
        file: ./coverage.xml
        fail_ci_if_error: true
```

### Step 3: Create Release Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.11'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install build twine
    
    - name: Build package
      run: python -m build
    
    - name: Check package
      run: twine check dist/*
    
    - name: Publish to PyPI
      env:
        TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
        TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        twine upload dist/*
```

### Step 4: Add PyPI Token to GitHub

1. Generate API token on PyPI
2. Go to your GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Add new secret: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`

Now when you create a release on GitHub, it automatically publishes to PyPI!
